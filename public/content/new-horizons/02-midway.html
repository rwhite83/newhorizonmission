        <p class="lead">The New Horizons trilogy is about a utopian vision of the future, a therapeutic thinking through
            of how it could all work out despite everything actually trending so negatively (and that was pre-Trump).
            It's set in Vancouver 150 years in the future, and focuses on a generational starship which leaves on a 150
            year journey to a distant neighbouring star.</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p class="lead">Midway, the second book, flips the situation and focuses on individuals halfway through the
            journey, the crew who grew up on the small ship, and who will inevitably die on the same small ship, and
            suffer this existence for the sake of other people's dreams, with no possibility of pursuing their own
            dreams. From maximum privilige, to none at all.
            <br><br>
            Despite careful social engineering, humanity bleeds through, and the gruesome first murder ever on
            the ship launches an investigation which unravels a plot by an original crewmember to undermine the core
            mission and find some way, any way, to construct a shred of authentic personally driven meaning in their
            lives, no matter what the costs.</p>
